### SVM: Popular and simple algorithm.

#### Geometric Intution:

Separate positive points from negative points by drawing multiple planes. We want a plane that separates my positive 
points from negative points as widely as possible from all other planes. That plane is called margin maximizing hyper plane.
SVM tries to find hyper plane that maximize the margin between positive and negative points. as margin increases, my generalization accuracy improves.
